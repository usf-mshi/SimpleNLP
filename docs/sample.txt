Coronary artery disease. Doing well. Continue aspirin, beta-blocker and statin. Cholesterol pretty good with LDL 80 and ALT fine as well in December.
Hypertension, well controlled. Continue atenolol.
Tobacco abuse. He was again told that he needs to quit and encouraged to use the patches.
Allergic rhinitis and possible sinusitis. We will try Singulair and a course of amoxicillin. As with my prior note, he may need to see ENT, as he is a smoker and this is a pretty new complaint for him.
History of abdominal aortic aneurysm with endovascular repair. Continue follow up with vascular surgery.
Health maintenance. He had multiple adenomatous polyps on colonoscopy in 2000. Form filled out for repeat colonoscopy. We reviewed the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening and he wishes not to be screened.
Return to clinic in six months.
